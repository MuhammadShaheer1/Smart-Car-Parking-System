# Smart-Car-Parking-System

One of the major techniques that forms the basis of all digitally integrated circuits is Digital 
Logic Design. Using these techniques we have come forth with a system aimed at aiding drivers 
with parking.


Due to the rapid increase in the number of vehicles on the road, traffic problems are also 
on the rise. This is due to the fact that the current transportation infrastructure and car parking
facilities developed are unable to cope with the influx of vehicles on the roads. One main problem 
is revealed to be the lack of a proper system to help vehicles park efficiently, given the exponential 
rise of huge parking areas and vehicles alike.


To alleviate the aforementioned problems, we have developed a “Smart Parking System”. 
With the implementation of the Smart Parking System, patrons can easily locate and secure a 
vacant parking space at any empty car park spot that is deemed convenient by them.


The main aim of this project is to effectively and efficiently provide a system that; helps in 
reducing the traffic that occurs within parking lots, furthermore works to reduce the time lost while 
searching around a place that is already at maximum capacity. Vehicle detection plays a crucial 
role in this, as the smart parking system is implemented through a system that uses the help of 
various sensors and counters, which help in keeping a check where a spot in the parking lot is 
currently empty and guides the drivers to that spot with the help of LEDs. In the entrance of the 
Parking Lot, a screen displays the car park map, showing where all the car parking spots are located 
and which spot is currently available for parking at that moment. Furthermore the system only 
allows entry to a specific number of vehicles that bring the parking lot to its maximum capacity, 
and thus blocks entry for any more vehicles that tries to enter. A red LED turns on in the entrance 
once the maximum capacity of the car park is reached.


The smart parking system is considered beneficial for the car park operators, car park 
patrons as well as for the conservation of the environment as it significantly reduces the amount 
of fuel burned going around in circles trying to find an empty spot. As this system is completely 
digitally implemented, there is no more need for Parking Workers, thus reducing the overall cost 
required to maintain the huge parking spots that are located outside of shopping malls, theaters, 
hospitals and airports e.t.c. Thus the implementation of this project solves problems from an 
environmental perspective to the perspective of a business where the cheapest yet most efficient 
solutions are preferred to avoid the expenditure of unnecessary excess money.


In Conclusion, the Smart Parking System is proposed to help combat the problems that 
arise in parking lots by providing a system that helps drivers to smoothly and quickly allocate an 
area to park without creating unnecessary traffic jams and wasting time going all around the 
parking lot
